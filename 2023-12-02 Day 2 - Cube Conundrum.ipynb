    "You're launched high into the atmosphere! <br>\n",
    "The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. <br>\n",
    "You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. <br>\n",
    "It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. <br>\n",
    "An Elf runs over to greet you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elf explains that you've arrived at **Snow Island** and apologizes for the lack of snow. <br>\n",
    "He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. <br>\n",
    "They don't get many visitors up here; would you like to play a game in the meantime?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. <br>\n",
    "Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. <br>\n",
    "He'll do this a few times per game.\n",
    "\n",
    "You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). <br>\n",
    "Each game is listed with its ID number (like the `11` in `Game 11: ...`) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the record of a few games might look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\n",
    "Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\n",
    "Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\n",
    "Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\n",
    "Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\n",
    "```\n",
    "In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). <br>\n",
    "The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained **only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes**?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been **possible** if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. <br>\n",
    "However, game 3 would have been **impossible** because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. <br>\n",
    "If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get **`8`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. <br>\n",
    "**What is the sum of the IDs of those games?**\n"

    "Game IDs with the number of cubes less that 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue can only be valid.<br>\n",
